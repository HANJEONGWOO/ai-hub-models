# TurboQuant KV-cache tools

Developer tools for the opt-in TurboQuant KV-cache codec in
`qai_hub_models.models.templates.llm.turboquant`. The ABI, numeric tolerances
and current results are in
[`tutorials/llm/turboquant_design.md`](../../../tutorials/llm/turboquant_design.md).

| Script | Purpose | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_constants.py` | Freeze codebooks and FWHT signs from turboquant_plus at the pinned commit; `--check` verifies `constants.py` | turboquant_plus checkout |
| `verify_reference.py` | Compare the in-repo oracle with the pinned reference; `--write-golden` refreshes the unit-test fixture | turboquant_plus checkout |
| `evaluate_qwen3_kv.py` | Host-only reference quality run (PPL/KL/KV stats) and real KV snapshot for device inputs | HF checkpoint, GPU recommended |
| `htp_codec_validation.py` | Build codec graphs, run them on an Android HTP device over adb, compare with the oracle | QAIRT 2.48, adb, SM8850 device |
| `split_checkpoint.py` | Split the shipped quantized checkpoint into per-part ONNX + encodings locally | downloaded checkpoint |
| `convert_parts.py` | Apply a TurboQuant profile via graph surgery, then QAIRT convert/quantize and build weight-shared HTP context binaries | QAIRT 2.48 |
| `qnn_runner/` | Dedicated on-device LLM runner on the public QNN C API; `build_android.sh` builds it | Android NDK r26c, QAIRT headers |
| `run_device_llm.py` | Prepare runner assets, push bundles over adb, run generate/score and collect JSON reports | adb, SM8850 device |
| `verify_kv_boundary.py` | Check from `qairt-dlc-info` output where the KV path is quantized: 16-bit write path from the tap (float16 for the codec, one explicit uFxp_16 grid for the uncompressed cache), codec/packed I/O without encodings, int8 only at the attention Concat | converted bundle |

Run from the repo root with `PYTHONPATH=src` so the repo sources shadow any
installed `qai_hub_models` wheel. None of these tools submit AI Hub jobs.
